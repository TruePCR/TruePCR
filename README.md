Notebook
--------
While developing the workflow, we are using a Python notebook.
Assuming you have your
[Python sci dev environment set up](http://www.scipy.org/install.html),
you can start it with:

    cd notebook
    ipython notebook --pylab=inline

And see it in your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:8888/](http://127.0.0.1:8888/).

If you just want to view the contents, you can see it on
[nbviewer][notebook-nbviewer] without installing anything.
